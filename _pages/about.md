(Chinese: 樊开砚)

I'm a Software Engineer at Jump Trading. I mainly work on High Frequency Trading infrastructure in C++.

Prior to that, I did my undergrad at Imperial College London. I also spent an exchange year at MIT.

I did my high school at Hangzhou Foreign Languages School. Proud to be an HFLSer!

I am interested in computer systems, particularly OS, distributed systems, and system security. During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of working with Professor [Adam Belay](http://www.abelay.me/) at MIT PDOS Group and Professor [Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/) at Imperial College LSDS Group.

I enjoy outdoor activities, including climbing, hiking, and karting. I've also been playing the piano for many years. I'm an enthusiastic player of a board game called [Twilight Struggle](https://twilight-struggle.com/) (find me on the ranking chart!).
