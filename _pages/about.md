(樊开砚)

I'm a Software Engineer at [Jump Trading](https://www.jumptrading.com/), working on High Frequency Trading systems.

Prior to that, I studied MEng Computing at Imperial College London and spent an exchange year at MIT. I did my high school at Hangzhou Foreign Languages School.

I am interested in computer systems, particularly OS, distributed systems, and networking. During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of working with Professor [Adam Belay](http://www.abelay.me/) at MIT PDOS Group and Professor [Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/) at Imperial College LSDS Group.

I enjoy many outdoor activities, such as cycling, hiking, archery, and karting. I also play piano. I'm an enthusiastic player of a boardgame called [Twilight Struggle](https://twilight-struggle.com/).
