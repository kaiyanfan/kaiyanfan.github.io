I'm Kaiyan Fan (Chinese: 樊开砚). I'm a final year undergraduate student at Imperial College London studying Computer Science. I'm currently on exchange at MIT.

I did my high school at [Hangzhou Foreign Languages School](http://www.chinahw.net/html_en/template/aboutus.html). Proud to be an HFLSer!

I am interested in computer systems. During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of working with Professor [Adam Belay](http://www.abelay.me/) at MIT PDOS Group and Professor [Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/) at Imperial LSDS Group.

I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities, including cycling, hiking, and karting. Recently I'm trying to pick up archery and sailing. I've been playing the piano for many years. I'm also an enthusiastic player of a board game called Twilight Struggle. My favourite video games are the ones from Paradox, such as EU4 and HOI4.
